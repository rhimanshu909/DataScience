Problem statement:
Assume that the business started in May 2017 and they sell products through 3 mediums:
-          Store
-          Dotcom
-          Online grocery (OG)
 

Customer science business partners would like to understand a couple of things:
-          Who are our best customers ?
-          What is the replenishment behavior like in Dotcom and OG (or) what drives customers to shop with us again ?
 
 
Desired output:
-          Well commented Jupyter notebook (or) R Markdown
